# searchBot

searchBot is a command line tool to save searches to e-comerce, online thrift shops or any other webpage providing 
searches for products and receive emails every time a new product matches the search.

Some e-comerce sites like ebay provides the concept of "saved searches", you can save a search and receive alerts any time 
a new product matches your search, but many others don't. With searchbot you can use one of already implemented webpage 
scrapers, register your search and use any job scheduler (like cron for linux) to regulary launch your searches.

DISCLAIMER: This is a Work in Progress so for the moment you will need touch the code to put your searches to work. In the 
future this will be configurable with a config file.
